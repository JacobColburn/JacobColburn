## About Me  
- 🏡 **From**: Alabama  
- 💻 **How It Started**: My love for computers began with my grandma introducing me to learning games over dial-up, and eventually, *RuneScape*. Growing up in a family that couldn't afford a computer, I didn't get my own until my 20s—making me even more determined to dive into the world of software development.
- 🎖 **Background**: Proudly served in the U.S. Army for 4 years, where I developed discipline, resilience, attention to detail, and a love for challenges.
- 🧠 **My Edge**: As a veteran and someone with ADHD, I thrive in fast-paced environments, enjoy thinking outside the box, and excel at tackling puzzles and challenges.  
- 🎮 **Fun Facts**: I’m a gamer, diamond-handed stock market nerd, and someone who’s constantly learning new skills.
